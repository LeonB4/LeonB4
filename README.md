Hi, I’m Guilherme Leoncio, but you can call me Leon due to my name being hard to use internationally.
I’m interested in creating games or software developing in general.
I’m currently learning java, but I have experience in C, php. And using the game developing tool Unity and using the programming language C#.
I have experience with the framework Scrum, with 1 year experience.
I’m looking to collaborate on game projects or any programming projects.
How to reach me: guilhermeleoncio2@hotmail.com (personal e-mail).
